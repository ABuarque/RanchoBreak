This app is a simple game made in C where a cow is running way from a butcher and you can help it to not became a barbecue.
To do so, over the path of cow there are some obstacles and you have to avoid them by jumping the cow.
Our cow has a kind of jet backpack whitch helps it to do long jumps, but be carefull, the fuel is limited

# Project knowledges used
+ On developing process, this app has used primitives for store things like players scores and the number of remaining lives of our cow;
+ Strings were used to handle words and playes names;  
+ Arrays and matrices were used to handle animation tasks like the movement;
+ Loops were used also to animation handling, together with arrays and matrices; 
+ Structs were used to model the player-user and the cow of game;
+ Functions were used to package and reuse instructions block like the function which returns a new player object; 
+ Pointers were used to create the tree and the pointers for structs of players and cow;
+ Files were used to handle the app data in such a way that we could persist them in a text file;
+ The Binary Search Tree data structure was used to hold all the players;
+ Recursion were used in some situations of the created Tree like searching within it; 
+ Condicionals were used to check some conditions like object colisions; 
+ Dinamic allocation was used to create pointers for our structs like creating a new player object;
+ Binary search algorithm was used to get players ranking on our tree;
+ We also used sorting process when we added new players into our tree;
